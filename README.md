# LanguageStructureFinal
Language Structure Final. The goal is to write a script using two different language paradigms to write a PPM image file. Even after the final, this will be updated intermittenly with the solutions in other languages. Folders currently in the project do not necessarily have solutions, but are planned to have solutions.
